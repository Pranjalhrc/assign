    <h1>B.Sc. (Hons.) Mathematics</h1>
    <section>
        Mathematics is usually described as the abstract science of number, quantity and space along
with their operations. The scope of Mathematics is very broad and it has a wide range of
applications in natural sciences, engineering, economics and social sciences. B.Sc. (Hons.)
Mathematics Programme aims at developing the ability to think critically, logically and
analytically and hence use mathematical reasoning in everyday life. Pursuing a degree in
mathematics will introduce the students to a number of interesting and useful ideas in
preparations for a number of mathematics careers in education, research, government sector,
business sector and industry.
The B.Sc. (Hons.) Mathematics programme covers the full range of mathematics, from
classical Calculus to Modern Cryptography, Information Theory, and Network Security. The
course lays a structured foundation of Calculus, Real & Complex analysis, Abstract Algebra,
Differential Equations (including Mathematical Modelling), Number Theory, Graph Theory,
and C++ Programming exclusively for Mathematics.
