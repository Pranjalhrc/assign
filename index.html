        Mathematics is usually described as the abstract science of number, quantity and space along
with their operations. The scope of Mathematics is very broad and it has a wide range of
applications in <b> natural sciences, engineering, economics and social sciences</b>. B.Sc. (Hons.)
Mathematics Programme aims at developing the ability to think critically, logically and
analytically and hence use mathematical reasoning in everyday life. Pursuing a degree in
mathematics will introduce the students to a number of interesting and useful ideas in <i>
    preparations for a number of mathematics careers in education, research, government sector,
business sector and industry. 
</i>
<br> <br>
The B.Sc. (Hons.) Mathematics programme covers the full range of mathematics, from
classical Calculus to <b>Modern Cryptography, Information Theory, and Network Security</b> . The
course lays a structured foundation of <i>Calculus, Real & Complex analysis, Abstract Algebra,
    Differential Equations (including Mathematical Modelling), Number Theory, Graph Theory,
    and C++ Programming exclusively for Mathematics</i> .</div>
